  <h1>Zmanim+ FAQ</h1>

  <h2>Subscription</h2>

  <h3>Will I be charged for Zmanim+ after the trial?</h3>

  <p>Due to how free trials work on the App Store, it is unfortunately not possible to have a free trial that does not automatically bill you at the end. If you choose not to continue with the subscription, you&#8217;ll need to cancel it before the trial runs out.</p>

  <h3>I&#8217;ve paid for Zmanim+. How can I share it with my family members?</h3>

  <p>Zmanim+ supports Family Sharing at no additional cost. So long as you have Apple&#8217;s Family Sharing system set up with your family, other family members will get Zmanim+ as long as you continue to pay for it.</p>

  <h3>How do I cancel my subscription?</h3>

  <p>You can cancel your Zmanim+ subscription by going to the settings, then &#8220;Zmanim+&#8221;.</p>

  <h3>What can I do with Zmanim+ Shortcuts?</h3>

  <p>Shortcuts is an app that is built-in to iOS that lets you create a sequence of actions, which can be run with a single tap.</p>

  <p>As a &#8220;power-user&#8221; feature, Zmanim integrates with Shortcuts, using the &#8220;Get Zman&#8221; action. Given a specific Zman, Modifier, and date, the Action will output the time it will occur. You can use this information on its own, or in conjunction with other actions. For example, you can add a task to Reminders with the due date set to a specific Zman</p>

  <p>Note that the action is limited to using the currently selected location in the app.</p>
